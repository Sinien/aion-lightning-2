/**
 * An editor that can be used to edit the tree column. This extends
 * DefaultCellEditor and uses a JTextField (actually, TreeTableTextField)
 * to perform the actual editing.
 * <p>To support editing of the tree column we can not make the tree
 * editable. The reason this doesn't work is that you can not use
 * the same component for editing and renderering. The table may have
 * the need to paint cells, while a cell is being edited. If the same
 * component were used for the rendering and editing the component would
 * be moved around, and the contents would change. When editing, this
 * is undesirable, the contents of the text field must stay the same,
 * including the caret blinking, and selections persisting. For this
 * reason the editing is done via a TableCellEditor.
 * <p>Another interesting thing to be aware of is how tree positions
 * its render and editor. The render/editor is responsible for drawing the
 * icon indicating the type of node (leaf, branch...). The tree is
 * responsible for drawing any other indicators, perhaps an additional
 * +/- sign, or lines connecting the various nodes. So, the renderer
 * is positioned based on depth. On the other hand, table always makes
 * its editor fill the contents of the cell. To get the allusion
 * that the table cell editor is part of the tree, we don't want the
 * table cell editor to fill the cell bounds. We want it to be placed
 * in the same manner as tree places it editor, and have table message
 * the tree to paint any decorations the tree wants. Then, we would
 * only have to worry about the editing part. The approach taken
 * here is to determine where tree would place the editor, and to override
 * the <code>reshape</code> method in the JTextField component to
 * nudge the textfield to the location tree would place it. Since
 * JTreeTable will paint the tree behind the editor everything should
 * just work. So, that is what we are doing here. Determining of
 * the icon position will only work if the TreeCellRenderer is
 * an instance of DefaultTreeCellRenderer. If you need custom
 * TreeCellRenderers, that don't descend from DefaultTreeCellRenderer, 
 * and you want to support editing in JTreeTable, you will have
 * to do something similiar.
