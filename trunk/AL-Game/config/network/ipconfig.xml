    File that is responsible for network address mapping.
    We can have any number of ip ranges mapped to various network interfaces
    Useful for those who run server in local areas with two (or more) networks

    For ipconfig's "default" attribute both DNS and ip address is supported.
    Example: <ipconfig default="216.239.59.104">
    Examples: <ipconfig default="google.de">

<ipconfig default="127.0.0.1">

    <!--
        IANA-reserved private IPv4 network ranges
        Access only from local networks, external client can't have any of
        the following ip addresses
     -->
    <iprange min="10.0.0.0" max="10.255.255.255" address="10.0.0.0"/>
